/*
Given a street of N houses (a row of houses), each house having K amount of money kept inside; now there is a thief who is going to steal this money but he has a constraint/rule that he cannot steal/rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum money he can rob.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5 , K = 10
Output:
30
Explanation:
The Robber can rob from the first, third
and fifth houses which will result in 30.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2 , K = 12
Output:
12
Explanation:
The Robber can only rob from the first
or second which will result in 12.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maximizeMoney() which takes 2 Integers N and K as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N,K <= 103
