/*
You will be given a positive integer N. Your task is to find the number of positive integers K â‰¤ N such that K is not divisible by any number among the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 11
Output:
2
Explanation:
1 and 11 are the only possible solutions.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 is the only possible solution.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function noOfNumbers() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1018
