/*
A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Return the index of the celebrity, if there is no celebrity return -1.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.
Follow Up: Can you optimize it to O(N)
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
M[][] = {{0 1},
         {1 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation: The two people at the party both
know each other. None of them is a celebrity.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function celebrity() which takes the matrix M and its size N as input parameters and returns the index of the celebrity. If no such celebrity is present, return -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 3000
0 <= M[][] <= 1

Intuition
The idea is to use two pointers, one from start and one from the end. Assume the start person is A, and the end person is B. If A knows B, then A must not be the celebrity. Else, B must not be the celebrity. At the end of the loop, only one index will be left as a celebrity. Go through each person again and check whether this is the celebrity. 
The Two Pointer approach can be used where two pointers can be assigned, one at the start and the other at the end, and the elements can be compared and the search space can be reduced.

Implementation
Create two indices i and j, where i = 0 and j = n-1
Run a loop until i is less than j.
Check if i knows j, then i can't be a celebrity. so increment i, i.e. i++
Else j cannot be a celebrity, so decrement j, i.e. j--
Assign i as the celebrity candidate
Now at last check whether the candidate is actually a celebrity by re-running a loop from 0 to n-1  and constantly checking that if the candidate knows a person or if there is a candidate who does not know the candidate, then we should return -1. else at the end of the loop, we can be sure that the candidate is actually a celebrity.
