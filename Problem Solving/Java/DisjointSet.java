/*
Given an array A[] that stores all number from 1 to N (both inclusive and sorted) and K queries.

The task is to do the following operations on array elements :

1. UNION X Z : Perform union of X and Z i.e. parent of Z will become the parent of X.
2. FIND X: Find the parent of X and print it.

Note: Initially all are the parent of themselves.

Input:
N = 5, K = 4
queries[] = {{find 4},
             {find 1},
             {unionSet 3 1},
             {find 3}}
Output:
4 1 1
Explanation:
1. The parent of 4 is 4. Hence the output is 4.
2. The parent of 1 is 1. Hence the output is 1.
3. After performing unionSet 3 1, parent of 3 becomes 1,
   since, parent of 1 is currently 1 itself.
4. The parent of 3 is now 1. Hence, the output is 1.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the functions- find() which takes an array A[] and an integer X as an input parameter and return the parent of X and the function unionSet() which takes an array A[] and two integers X and Z and performs the union of X and Z.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N, K <= 100
