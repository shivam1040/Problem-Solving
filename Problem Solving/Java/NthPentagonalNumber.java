/*
Given an integer n, find the nth Pentagonal number. First three pentagonal numbers are 1, 5 and 12 (Please see below diagram).The nâ€™th pentagonal number Pn is the number of distinct dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the outlines of regular pentagons with sides up to n dots, when the pentagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex.

Pentagonal Number



Example 1:

Input:
n = 1 
Output:
1 
Explanation:
See the diagram given above.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 2 
Output:
5
Explanation:
See the diagram given above.
Example 3:

Input:
n = 3
Output:
12
Explanation:
See the diagram given above.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getNthPentagonalNum() which takes an Integer n as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
