/*
Metro roams in a city of 20 stations, Starting from Station number 0 to last station 19. It Stops at each station for 1 sec (neglect the time of station switching). A Guy daily waits at station number 11 for the train. Given n i,e current station no. at which metro is and its direction c, find the time he has to wait to catch up the train.

Example 1:

Input:  n = 0, c = U
Output: 11
Explanation: Since train is at station number 
0, so the guy has to wait 11 sec.
Example 2:

Input: n = 12, c = D
Output: 1
Explanation: Since train is at station number
12 and its direction is down it means the guy
has to wait for only 1 sec.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function waiting_time() which takes n and c as input parameter and returns the time for which the guy has to wait.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Compelxity: O(1)

Constraints:
0 <= n <= 19
c â‚¬ ['D', 'U']
